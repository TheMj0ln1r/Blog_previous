Hello guys! I played <a href="https://play.picoctf.org/events/72" target=_blank>picoCTF 2023</a> competition ("picoCTF 2023" or the "Competition") organized by Carnegie Mellon University ("CMU"). I scored 3000+ points in this CTF. These are the challenges i solved during the CTF. 

- ### General Skills
	- chrono
	- money-ware
	- permissions
	- repitiotions
	- useless

- ### Binary Exploitation
	- two-sum
	- VNE

Most of these are basic challenges, so I would like to explain few challenges which are interested me.

# Special

![Special](/assets/img/post_img/pico23_special.png)

As suggested i used ssh to login to the special machine. And i tried some commands there but those are spell checked by the machine and it results an error to execute the commands. I tries piping technique together with cat command to find the flag location and print out.

```
Special$ ls
Is 
sh: 1: Is: not found
Special$ cat *
Cat * 
sh: 1: Cat: not found
Special$ cat | cat *
Cat | cat * 
sh: 1: Cat: not found
cat: blargh: Is a directory
Special$ cat | cat blargh/*
Cat | cat blargh/* 
sh: 1: Cat: not found
picoCTF{5p311ch3ck_15_7h3_w0r57_6a2763f6}
```

> `Flag : picoCTF{5p311ch3ck_15_7h3_w0r57_6a2763f6}`

# Specialer

![Special](/assets/img/post_img/pico23_specialer.png)

It is similar to the special challenge. Logged into challenge machine and tried few commands to execute.

```
ctf-player@saturn.picoctf.net's password: 
Specialer$ ls
-bash: ls: command not found
Specialer$ echo *
abra ala sim
Specialer$ echo abra/*     
abra/cadabra.txt abra/cadaniel.txt
Specialer$ echo ala/*
ala/kazam.txt ala/mode.txt
Specialer$ echo sim/*
sim/city.txt sim/salabim.txt
Specialer$ 
```

Using echo I discovered the files present in the machine. Tried to read abra/cadabra.txt with echo. It is not the flag, and the flag is present in the ala/kazam.txt.

```
Specialer$ echo "$(<abra/cadabra.txt)"
Nothing up my sleeve!
Specialer$ echo "$(<ala/kazam.txt)"
return 0 picoCTF{y0u_d0n7_4ppr3c1473_wh47_w3r3_d01ng_h3r3_38f5cc78}
Specialer$ 
```

# two-sum

![two-sum](/assets/img/post_img/pico23_twosum.png)

The source code of the challenge:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

static int addIntOvf(int result, int a, int b) {
    result = a + b;
    if(a > 0 && b > 0 && result < 0)
        return -1;
    if(a < 0 && b < 0 && result > 0)
        return -1;
    return 0;
}

int main() {
    int num1, num2, sum;
    FILE *flag;
    char c;

    printf("n1 > n1 + n2 OR n2 > n1 + n2 \n");
    fflush(stdout);
    printf("What two positive numbers can make this possible: \n");
    fflush(stdout);
    
    if (scanf("%d", &num1) && scanf("%d", &num2)) {
        printf("You entered %d and %d\n", num1, num2);
        fflush(stdout);
        sum = num1 + num2;
        if (addIntOvf(sum, num1, num2) == 0) {
            printf("No overflow\n");
            fflush(stdout);
            exit(0);
        } else if (addIntOvf(sum, num1, num2) == -1) {
            printf("You have an integer overflow\n");
            fflush(stdout);
        }

        if (num1 > 0 || num2 > 0) {
            flag = fopen("flag.txt","r");
            if(flag == NULL){
                printf("flag not found: please run this on the server\n");
                fflush(stdout);
                exit(0);
            }
            char buf[60];
            fgets(buf, 59, flag);
            printf("YOUR FLAG IS: %s\n", buf);
            fflush(stdout);
            exit(0);
        }
    }
    return 0;
}
```

We have to input `n1 and n2`  those satisfies `n1 > n1 + n2 OR n2 > n1 + n2`. Mathematically this is not possible. But in computer memory its possible.

This can be done with simple integer overflow.

The `n1` and `n2` are declared as signed integers.

Signed int range for

 2 bytes(-32,768 to 32,767)
 4 bytes(-2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647)

If we store `2,147,483,648` in a signed 4 byte integer it will become `-2,147,483,648`.

Take `n1 = 2,147,483,648` `n2 = 2,147,483,649`

Here `n1` becomes `-2,147,483,648` `n2` becomes `-2,147,483,647` 

Therefore, `n1 + n2 = -2,147,483,648 + (-2,147,483,647)`

![two-sum](/assets/img/post_img/pico23_twosum1.png)

But here, `n1>0 and n2>0` not satisfied. We only get the flag if it does.

So, we can select two numbers whose sum is  `2147483648.` Then the result will be `-2147483648`.

Take `n1 = 2147483640 and n2 = 8`

Then `n1 + n2 = 2147483648` , it will be stored as `-2147483648`
