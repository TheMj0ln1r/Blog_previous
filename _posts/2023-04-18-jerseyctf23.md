```
Submitted this in flag format, but it doesn't worked for me. The did a quick google search these words. And i found that these are the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NATO_phonetic_alphabet" target=_blank>**NATO phonetic alphabets**</a>. And decoded it by following the representations of this words. 

Lima - l<br>Alpha - a<br>Kilo - k<br> Echo - e<br> and so on.

Ciphertext is given : `pgQVJFCohpccuyBSbwxcxpVZCAATRT`. A 2x2 matrix is given [[3,9],[4,7]].

By observing the description i found that this is a `hill cipher`. I quickly searched for the hill cipher decoder online. I used <a href="https://www.dcode.fr/hill-cipher" target=_blank>this site</a> to decipher the text.

The challenge have this attachment <a href="/assets/files/jerseyctf23/message_from_tom.txt" download>message_from_tom.txt </a>

First of all, I observed a `==` at the end of the content of the file. Immediated I decoded it from base64 and stored in other file. And the file size is a bit suspicious so I observed its hexdump. It contains a PNG header. So, I renamed the image image into decoded.png. Then i opened the image it has the flag in it.

```bash

# roko-cipher-in-the-console

![roko](/assets/img/post_img/jersey_roko.png)

We can see this is a transpositional cipher. `f1stg}th10_ej{s__act_nam`. I observed that the flag is plaintext but it was transposed. We can observe that the `jctf{}` letters in the ciphertext. 

I wrote this ciphertext in different deapths. Like writing it in 4 columns, 5 columns and so on . I observed a standard format when I write this in 6 columns. 

![rokocol](/assets/img/post_img/jersey_roko1.png)

We can get the flag by reading column by column and in every column the order of reading letters is row-3,row-4,row-2,row-1.

That is first column should be taken as `jctf`. Second column is `{th1` and so on.

# supply-stash

![supplystash2](/assets/img/post_img/jersey_supply2.png)

This is medium level challenge in crypto. The challenge has a java file name `numericalEncoder.java`

```java
//Encoding program originally by Logan DesRochers
import java.lang.Math;
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.Scanner; 

public class numericalEncoder{ 
	public static void main(String[] args){ 
		String alphabet = "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz";
		Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in); 
		System.out.println("Enter string to be encoded: ");
		String m = sc.nextLine(); 
		m = m.toLowerCase(); 
		System.out.println("Enter int block size: ");
		int r = sc.nextInt();  

		//padding to variable block size 
		if(m.length() % r != 0){ 
			while(m.length() % r != 0){ 
				m = m + "x";
			}
		}
		System.out.println("M after padding: " + m);
		
		//Variable block size 
		ArrayList<Integer> encodedBlocks = new ArrayList<Integer>();
		int numBlocks = m.length() / r; 
		for(int i = 0; i < numBlocks; i++){ 
			String block = m.substring(i * r, r + i * r); 
			System.out.println(block);
			int power = block.length() - 1;
			int representation = 0;
			for(int j = 0; j < block.length(); j ++){
                        	String currentLetter = block.substring(j,j+1);
                        	int letterValue = alphabet.indexOf(currentLetter);
                        	representation += letterValue * Math.pow(26, power);
                        	power--;
                	} 
			encodedBlocks.add(representation);
		}
	        System.out.println("Encoded blocks are as follows: ");	
		for(int num : encodedBlocks){
			System.out.println(num);
		}
	}
}
```

The output of the above code is `SUPPLIES: 6639182 5837362 7923517 8463981 3588695 8358510"` and this is the encoded vesion of our flag. So analyzed the code and reversed the encoding program.

My observations are, the above code is doing generating a integer for for a block of characters. That is `6639182` is on encoded version of a block of characters. This is generated by accessing the index of the character from alphabet string and this is multiplied `pow(26,power)` where `power=len(block)-1` and this power is decreased for every new character in the block. 

Okay, lets have some math. lets assume block size = 4 <br>power = 3<br>the initial encoded block value will become<br> `index(char)x26^3 + index(char)x26^2 + index(char)x26^1 + index(char)x26^0`<br>
Simply it is doing a `base26` operation. So, in the decode program, we have to perform decoding of base26.

This is the solution script which can give the decoded message from encoded blocks.

```python
import string
alphabet = string.ascii_lowercase
input_str = input("Enter numerical blocks to be decoded (separated by spaces): ")
# split input into individual numerical blocks
input_blocks = input_str.split(" ")
decoded_blocks = []
for block in input_blocks:
    num = int(block)
    decoded = ""
    while num > 0:
        remainder = num % 26
        decoded_letter = alphabet[remainder]
        decoded = decoded_letter + decoded
        num //= 26
    decoded_blocks.append(decoded)
# combine decoded blocks into original message
decoded_message = "".join(decoded_blocks)
print("Decoded message: " + decoded_message)
#6639182 5837362 7923517 8463981 3588695 8358510

# play-reasonably

![playreasonably](/assets/img/post_img/jersey_play.png)

This one is a special challenge. I spent more than an hour to solve this. And at the end of the ctf play-reasonably has only 11 solves.

Okay coming to challenge, I searched many keywords online but I havent find any thing positive. By observing carefully the ciphertext looks like it is from an old cipher. And I know about play-fair cipher. And they said play-reasonably and it matched with it. So, i started deciphering this playfair ciphertext.

Ciphertext : `WTATRHABWKYKACBMWD`<br>
I tried it with the key `THEBOYSAREBACKINTOWN` as the description highlighted it. I solved it with pen and paper as i know the working of playfair. Tried evry possible 5x5 key matrix.

`THEBOYSARCKINWDFGLMPQUVXZ (-J)`<br>`THEBOYSARCKINWDFGJLMPQUXZ (-V)`<br>
`THEBOYSARCKINWDFGJLMPUVXZ (-Q)`<br>`THEBOYSARCKINWDFGJLMPQUVX (-Z)`<br>
None of them are worked. So, I read the description again, They said `theboysarebackintown` are playing in reverse.<br> So, I tried the key matrix in reverse order. <br>
`NWOTIKCABERSYH` And the key matrix will be `NWOTIKCABERSYHDFGLMPQUVXZ (-J)`<br>

And I got the plaintext : `NOBODYCANCRACKTHIS`<br>
Here is my paper work might help you out.

# Web - Look-Im-Hacking

![look](/assets/img/post_img/jersey_lookim.png)

A simple web challenge. The challenge url has the login page. I looked at the source code of it. And found this script.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">

<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="text/html">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Document</title>

    <script type="text/javascript">
        var passkey = '';

        function createPass() {
            const valids = "ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz0123456789$#@!&%"
            for (let i = 0; i < 20; i++) {
                passkey += valids.charAt(Math.floor(Math.random() * valids.length))
            }
            passkey = btoa(passkey);
        }

        function checkPass() {
            console.log(passkey)
            if (document.getElementById("un1").value == "admin" && document.getElementById("pw2").value == atob(passkey)) {
                loadFlag();
            }
        }

        function loadFlag() {
            const xhttp = new XMLHttpRequest();
            xhttp.onload = function () {
                document.getElementById("reveal").innerHTML = this.responseText;
            }
            xhttp.open("GET", "./flag.txt")
            xhttp.send();
        }
    </script>
</head>
````

Found that there is a `/flag.txt` end point. And simply curling it results the flag.

# Forensics - firefox-history

Attached file : <a href="/assets/files/jerseyctf23/places.sqlite" download>places.sqlite</a>

So, i quickly searched for sqlite viewer online (I dont want to install additionally :) )

Found <a href="https://inloop.github.io/sqlite-viewer/" target=_blank>this site</a> to view sqlite file.

As the file name hints places. So selected `moz_places` table to view.

![firefox places](/assets/img/post_img/jersey_firefox1.png)

As the description said, i looked for the jerseyctf.com entry in the table. It was on 137th row.

![firefox jersey](/assets/img/post_img/jersey_firefox2.png)

I copied the last time visited value of the 137th entry. As the flag format is `jctf{YYYY-MM-DD-HH-MM-SS}` of this time, I used a seconds to epoch converter to get this format.

`1674907264007000` to epoch on <a href="https://www.epochconverter.com/" target=_blank> this site </a>

![firefox epoch](/assets/img/post_img/jersey_firefox3.png)

And the correct format is the date in GMT that is `2023-01-28-12-01-04`

# OSINT - record-me

![recordme](/assets/img/post_img/jersey_record.png)

The challenge is highlighting `record` and `jerseyctf.com`. So, I search for all the DNS records of jerseyctf.com.

I search all the `whois` records of the jerseyctf.com. And in there a string `pw-d714d7aa25df63925ec2b3893928671b`. As they are talking about password `pw` tempts me to submit it as flag.<br>But afer many unsuccesful tries I tried `dig` to fetch `DNS records` of jerseyctf.com.

And finally the flag is available at `TXT records` of jerseyctf.com. I used `dig` to do it.

```sh
mj0ln1r@Linux:~/osint$ dig jerseyctf.com txt

# Misc - pits-of-tartarus

![pits](/assets/img/post_img/jersey_pits.png)

The attached file : <a href="/assets/files/jerseyctf23/file834.tar.gz" download>file834.tar.gz</a>

This tar is a hundrends of recompressions of tar.gz

So, I run this command to loop over all the compressions in it and extract the files. 

```sh
mj0ln1r@Linux:~/misc$ for i in {834..1}; do tar -xf file$i.tar.gz; rm file$i.tar.gz; done
mj0ln1r@Linux:~/misc$ ls
file0.tar.gz
```
The above command will extract the zips and deletes it prior zip to make directory clean. As we can see now `file0.tar.gz` is the last one left.

Again this `file0.tar.gz` contains zips from file-1.tar.gz, and so on. So i extracted file0.tar.gz just one time then modified above command lil bit to extract this sequece of tars.

```sh
mj0ln1r@Linux:~/misc$ tar -xf file0.tar.gz
mj0ln1r@Linux:~/misc$ ls
file-1.tar.gz
mj0ln1r@Linux:~/misc$ for i in {1..833}; do tar -xf file-$i.tar.gz; rm file-$i.tar.gz; done
tar: file-390.tar.gz: Cannot open: No such file or directory
tar: Error is not recoverable: exiting now
mj0ln1r@Linux:~/misc$ ls
file.txt
mj0ln1r@Linux:~/misc$ cat file.txt
jctf{N0t_$tuck_in_tHe_t@r}
```
 I assumed that there will be again 834 zips so I tried the above loop. But actually there were only `389` tars. Eventhough the above command extracted the file that we want but returned some error. The flag is present in `file.txt`

Attached file : <a href="/assets/files/jerseyctf23/Databse.kdbx" download>Databse.kdbx</a>

This time I installed `keepassx` on my machine.

```sh
mj0ln1r@Linux:~/misc$ sudo apt install keepassx
```
And I Opened the Database.kdbx with kepassx GUI app. It prompts me for a master password. As the challenge hints that crack, I cracked it with `JOHN` and `rockyou.txt`.

```sh
mj0ln1r@Linux:~/misc$ keepass2john Database.kdbx >> database_hashes_new.hash

```
Master key of the database is `1jersey`.

So, I opened it the database file with master key. When I am navigating through the database file in keepassx app. I found a file named `flag` in General category.
