Hello mate, I played <a href="https://ctftime.org/event/2107" target=_blank>MetaRedCTF</a>. I am too late to the party got few hours to play, but solved few blockchain challenges. Challenges are not available after CTF, so I can't explain in detail what the challenge is. I try my best to explain what I did.

# Blockchain 

## GiveMeMoney [500pts]

Challenge is to find network and contract method to call. We are given with contract address. 

**0xA2720666b2e3D878b0E7FC80bc1D02958EA648DE**

Initiated a foundry project quickly. 

`forge init`

Created the solution script under `/scripts`.

`SolveGiveMeMoney.s.sol`

```javascript
// SPDX-License-Identifier: UNLICENSED
pragma solidity ^0.8.13;

import "forge-std/Script.sol";
contract GiveMeMoneyScript is Script {
    function setUp() public {}

    function run() public {
        vm.startBroadcast();
        solveGiveMeMoney();
        vm.stopBroadcast();
    }
    function solveGiveMeMoney() public {
        address target = 0xA2720666b2e3D878b0E7FC80bc1D02958EA648DE;
        (bool success, ) = target.call{value:0.101 ether}(abi.encodeWithSignature("deposit(string)","ODM1.pHrlmtdBQY9UIYaE-WVDGTPOWP0"));
        require(success);
    }
}
```

This script will call the contract method `deposit()` with the string provided in the challenge as arguement. We have to send above `0.1 Eth` along with the call.

To run the script we need to find the network of the contract. It is `Goerli`, Found from etherscan. We need some test ether mined it from goerli POW faucet. 

To run the script :

```bash
mj0ln1r@AHLinux:~/$ forge script scripts/SolveGiveMeMoney.s.sol --rpc-url <REDACTED> --private-key <REDACTED> --broadcast
```

The RPC-URL can create from alchemy, private-key is your testing wallet private key. 

We wont get the flag, the challenge will be automatically solved once we run this.

## Open [500pts]

**Contract : 0x35388184260d8A3cE75B5df5bbA1904b68746b27**

This challenge is also kinda same, the solve script is as follows,

`SolveOpen.s.sol`

```javascript
// SPDX-License-Identifier: UNLICENSED
pragma solidity ^0.8.13;

import "forge-std/Script.sol";
import {console} from "forge-std/console.sol";

contract OpenScript is Script {
    function setUp() public {}

    function run() public {
        vm.startBroadcast();
        solveOpen();
        vm.stopBroadcast();
    }
    function solveOpen() public {
        address target = 0x35388184260d8A3cE75B5df5bbA1904b68746b27;
        (bool success, bytes memory _data) = target.call(abi.encodeWithSignature("givemetheflag(string)","ODM1.pHrlmtdBQY9UIYaE-WVDGTPOWP0"));
        require(success);
        console.logBytes(_data);
    }
}
```

To run the script :

```bash
mj0ln1r@AHLinux:~/$ forge script scripts/SolveOpen.s.sol --rpc-url <REDACTED> --private-key <REDACTED> --broadcast
```

Flag will be automatically submitted once we run this script.

## Ether Footprint [500pts]

Challenge provided with a contract address. And description says observe the ether dance. 

**Contract : 0x24D1a591b816C175eBF4cD62277ecCcdA42d1211**

When I look the transactions to the given contract on goerli etherscan, there are 37 transactions available. I observed that the eth value in every transaction was different. I saw in the challenge tag something like `9856855-9856895`. These two numbers are block numbers of the starting trransaction and last block number of the transaction to this contract. 

Look here to observe : <a heref="https://goerli.etherscan.io/txs?a=0x24D1a591b816C175eBF4cD62277ecCcdA42d1211" target=_blank>Goerli Etherscan</a>

So, I used `web3.py` to list all the transaction to the target contract between these two block numbers. I fetched the value of each transaction in wei. I observed the `0,1 indexes` of the wei string represents the index of the character. And `4,5,6` indexes are the ascii values of the flag. 

I wrote this `web3.py` script which solves challenge and prints flag for us. 

`Solve.py`

```python
from decimal import Decimal
from web3 import *
START_BLOCK = 9856855
END_BLOCK = 9856895

RPC_URL = "https://eth-goerli.g.alchemy.com/v2/xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"
def main():
  values = []
  w3 = Web3(Web3.HTTPProvider(RPC_URL))
  for _block in range(START_BLOCK+1, END_BLOCK):
    block = w3.eth.get_block(_block, full_transactions=True)
    for transaction in block.transactions:
      if transaction["to"] == "0x24D1a591b816C175eBF4cD62277ecCcdA42d1211":
        print(_block,transaction["value"])
        values.append(transaction["value"])
  d = {}
  for i in values:
    string = str(i)
    if(len(string) != 15):
      string = ((15 - len(string)) * "0") + string + "x"# extra x to identify padded str
    if(string[-1] == "x"):
      d[int(string[0:2])] = chr(int(string[4:7]))
    else:
      d[int(string[0:2])] = chr(int(string[4:7]))
  for i in range(37):
    print(d[i],end="")



if __name__ == "__main__":
  main()

# Output

# flag{Gg_g00d_j0b_3th3r3um_1s_4w3s0m3}

```

Yeah Ethereum is awesome...
