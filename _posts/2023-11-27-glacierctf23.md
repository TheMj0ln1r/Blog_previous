Hey hi, I played <a href="https://ctftime.org/event/1992" target=_blank>Glacier CTF 2023</a>. I joined with <a href="https://ctftime.org/team/116280" target=_blank>CyberSpace</a> a wonderful team to work with. We got **`14th`** place in this CTF. I am focused on my fav smart contract challenges and solved ALL of them. Let me share those ATTACK scripts here.

## GlacierCoin [68pts]

Description :

"You start your journey up the glacier, to get to new heights (maybe even the moon). To get up the first part of the glacie you will need a guide to help you. The cheapest guide that you find charges you 1000 glacier coins, but unfortunately you only have 10. Find a way to pay the guide. To get the ticket, run solve-pow.py"

```

Observations :

1. We are given with setup contract address
2. Setup contract deployes the GlacierCoin contract and funds with 10 ether
3. GlacierCoin is a non-standard token contracts with buy, sell, freeze features

Goal : 

- The goal is to make the GlacierCoin balance 0 (look at isSolved() in Setup)

We can simply look at the `sell()` function which is susceptable to the great `Reentrancy`. The balance of the sender updated after the external call. So, we can simply write an Attack contract with a fallback function `Reenter` into the `sell()` function.

Attack : 

1. Buy 10 coins in GlacierCoin with 10 ether
2. Sell it back
3. Reenter into sell again from fallback

## GlacierVault [316pts]

```
Description :

"Ascending the glacier under the guidance of your seasoned expedition leader, you encounter a breathtaking sight: a vault intricately carved into the ice, its entrance guarded by a formidable sentinel. This ancient guardian stands watch, an imposing figure resolute in its duty. To gain access to the enigmatic vault and its concealed treasures, you must devise a clever strategy to lull the guardian into a deep, peaceful slumber, a challenge that awaits your resourcefulness and cunning. To get the ticket, run solve-pow.py"

Observations : 

1. Setup contract deployes Guardian and GlacierVault contracts
2. Guardian contract uses GlacierVault logic to perform some task
3. Guardian contract `delegatecall`'s the GlacierVault

Goal : 

- Put the Guardian contract into sleep

To put the Guardian contract into sleep we need to call the `punch()` with 10_000_000 ethers or we have to be the owner of the contract. Point to note about delegatecall is "With delegatecall, only the code of the given address is used but all other aspects (storage, balance, msg.sender etc.) are taken from the current contract. The purpose of delegatecall is to use library/logic code which is stored in callee contract but operate on the state of the caller contract".

So, here the call to GlacierVault will effect the storage layout of the Guardian contract. I tried to call the `quickStore()` function with arguements (0,1) on Guardian contract which delegates the call to GlacierVault. In result the owner variable slot of the Guardian contract was overridden with 1. So, we can able to overwrite the owner of the Guardian by calling quickStore() function. Now simply I called the quickStore() function with address of my attack contract instead of 1. So it will override the owner to my Attack contract address. Now we can call the `putToSleep()` function.

Observations : 

1. Setup contract deploys ChairLift contract and updates tripsTaken to 1
2. ChairLift contract deploys and uses Ticket contract
3. Ticket contract is not a standard token contract
4. Ticket contract uses `ecrecover` to verify the signature

Goal : 

- Goal is to update the tripsTaken variable to 2

To update the tripsTaken we have to call the function `takeRide()` with a ticket Id as arguement.

```javascript
function takeRide(uint256 ticketId) external
{
    require (ticket.ownerOf(ticketId) == msg.sender, "You don't own this ticket");
    tripsTaken += 1;
    ticket.burn(ticketId);
}
```

To call the takeRide function we need a ticket. To buy a ticket it costs 1 million ether, too expensive ride. So we need find a way to steal ticket. 

There is an interesting function `transferWithPermit()` which uses ecrecover to verify signature.

```javascript
function transferWithPermit(address from, address to, uint256 tokenId, uint256 deadline, uint8 v, bytes32 r, bytes32 s) public {
    require(block.timestamp <= deadline, "Ticket: permit expired");
    bytes32 digest = keccak256(abi.encodePacked("\x19\x01", _getDomainSeparator(), keccak256(abi.encode(PERMIT_TYPEHASH, from, to, tokenId, nonces[from]++, deadline))));
    address signer = ecrecover(digest, v, r, s);
    require(signer == from, "Ticket: invalid permit");
    _transfer(from, to, tokenId);
}
```

We can transfer ticket to an address if we have the signature of a ticket owner. We cant get the signature of someone. Lets see who are the owners of some tickets.

```javascript
mapping (uint256 => address) private _owners;
```

Here we know that the default owner of a ticket is `0` address. In the `burn()` function also updates the owner of the ticket to `address(0)`. So, If we managed to get the signature of the `address(0)` and set the from address to `0` as the from address check is not done inside the transferWithPermit() function.

By simply researching about ecrecover we can get to know that values of `v - 0, r - 0, s - 0` will recover the address of `0`. Now passing the from address as 0, signature values as 0 will bypass the signature check and transfers a ticket to our specified address. Then simply calling takeRide function will increment the tripsTaken variable.

This was an interesting and a bit of hard chall I would say, It took me more than an half day to understand the code base and solve the challenge. 

To solve the challenge we need to understand the entire code base, how the tokens are deployed, what is our goal, etc.

At an high level our goal is to call the `dissolveCouncilOfTheApes()` function of `CouncilOfApes` contract. To call this function we need to upgrade our user class from `APE` to `GORILLA`. For this we should have more than `1_000_000_000` votes. An `APE` can vote it self with the `balanaBalance`. To get `1_000_000_000` votes we should have `1_000_000_000` bananabalance, but we only have 1. 

To get more bananaBalance we should exchange our `IcyTokens`, But we dont have them. We can get the `FlashLoan` of `IcyTokens`. To get pass the checks in FlashLoan function we should deploy our own Token with totalSupply less than `100_000_000`. And we need to create pool on `IcyExchange` contract. 

After creating a fake custom token and creating a pool we can able to get a FlashLoan of required amount. Then I took flashloan and used those IcyTokens to buy bananaBalance and voted my self to update the class to GORILLA from APE. Then there is way to mint more bananaBalance using `issueBanana()` function then I used `sell()` to exchange bananaBalance with `IcyTokens` and I repayed those tokens back to IcyExchange cause I took flashloan from it.
